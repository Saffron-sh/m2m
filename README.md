# m2m
A minimal bash tool to convert video files to any other supported media files using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
The $YTDIR filepath points to $HOME/Music/ytdownloads because it was first created with the intent to
download youtube videos using yt-dlp and then convert them using ffmpeg.

YOU MUST PASS TWO ARGUMENTS, FIRST THE LINK OF THE VIDEO AND THEN THE NAME OF THE FILE.EXTENSION YOU 
WANT IT TO BE CONVERTED TO.

e.g- m2m https://yourvideourl converted.mp3 

change .mp3 to any media format desired.
